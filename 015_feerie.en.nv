In light of the faint dawn, the sinister mansion that spawned the blackest of the dragons and the palest of the fairies was casting ill-defined shadows. The livid firmament itself seemingly wanted to move away, his stringy clouds manifesting an obvious reluctance to fly over the sharp towers of the building. A high metallic fence encircled it as a shining case and no laughing tree, no rushing stream, no carefree animal seemed to have ever entered its domain. It reigned such a desolation there that even the decomposing bodies stuck in the surrounding piles seemed incongruously joyful.
Even his horse had declined to pursue further, but the knight did not bother for the slightest moment. Encased in his ceremonial armor, his unwavering faith supported him better than a thousand of his peers. He had never failed, and this would never happen during his lifetime. One could read in his steely gaze a unmatched determination, strengthened by his total lack of mind awareness. He passed the grid that had just opened on his passage with a mournful creak, just like the complaint of thousand damned rising from the fiery heart of Hell. The lack of any vegetation or any ornamentation or mere presence was a painful challenge to the imagination. Even the ground seemed to be made of nothing in its unalterable uniformity. An equally insipid silence filled the air, only broken by the melody of a nursery rhyme. Yet again, this had no effect and did not recall anything to the knight. As long as he could remember, he was in armor, riding a horse, his sword blazing in the light of day. He followed his path with a monotonous pace while the complex structure of the evil house was growing at every step, imposing its fa√ßade to his retina.
had been very clear with the knight and he was acutely aware of his duty. He had to slay the dragon and free the fairy kept by it. In return, she would grant him a wish that would allow him to save his kingdom. It was always the same story, the one that man wrote in books since this idea first appeared, and the knight had no worries nor illusions: he never had.

He was not surprised when the mansion's roof disappeared in a deafening crash, accompanied by curling pieces of wood and metal that fell whistling all around him. The rare sun beams that still reached the place were stopped by the smoke, and moreover by the terrifying mass of the dragon, its thick black scales absorbing all the light. Only shone in this ending night were the fierce glare of the huge eyes of the beast, looking like two bloody rubies. It uttered a piercing shriek and illuminated the improvised arena with a flow of crackling flames. The knight slowly unsheathed Yfia, his enchanted sword that also glowed in the dark. The wisest wizards of the kingdom had worked for decades on it; it surpassed in value many great cities of the world and had accompanied the knight for countless years.
